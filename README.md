# NYC Restaurants Food Delivery Statistical Analysis

This repository contains the complete statistical analysis and modeling of a real-world dataset sourced from Food Hub, a food delivery platform operating in New York City. The project was developed as part of the MA-541 course under the guidance of Prof. Hong Do.

## 📊 Project Overview

With over 1,899 rows of restaurant order data, the dataset reflects customer behavior and operational factors such as:
- Cuisine type
- Order cost
- Ratings
- Food preparation and delivery time
- Ordering patterns across days of the week

The primary objective of this project is to explore, analyze, and build statistical models that offer insights to improve customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

## 🧪 Key Components

### 1. Data Overview
- Dataset of 9 variables including cost, delivery time, and cuisine type
- Summary statistics and correlation analysis

### 2. Data Description
- Histograms and scatter plots
- Time series analysis
- Normality assessment using QQ plots

### 3. Distribution Analysis
- Shapiro-Wilk tests for normality
- Interpretation of skewness and outliers

### 4. Central Limit Theorem (CLT)
- Validation using sample means of preparation time
- Histogram and QQ plot visualization

### 5. Confidence Intervals
- 95% confidence intervals for mean estimates
- Comparison with true population parameters

### 6. Hypothesis Testing
- T-tests, ANOVA, and Chi-square tests
- Insights on customer behavior, delivery trends, and cuisine preferences

### 7. Model Fitting and Regression
- Correlation analysis
- Linear and multiple regression modeling
- Model diagnostics and evaluation using R² and residual plots

### 8. Residual Analysis & Model Selection
- Evaluation of linear model assumptions
- Suggestions for model improvement and segmentation strategies

## 📈 Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Statsmodels)
- Jupyter Notebook
- MS Excel (for some statistical computations)
- LaTeX/Word for documentation
